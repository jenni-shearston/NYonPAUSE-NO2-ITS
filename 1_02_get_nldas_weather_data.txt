Description of process to get NLDAS data 
Overall, we first make a list of URLS that will download all of the data. Then we use the wget command to access each url and download everything. Finally, we convert the data to a long data format that can be saved as a csv. 
Step-by-step Instructions
0) Create an account at https://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 
You will need the user name and password to download the data
You will also need to add NASA GESDISC DATA ARCHIVE to your list of approved applications in your EARTHDATA LOGIN account, following these instructions: https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/earthdata-login
1) Create a folder in the project directory called nldas_YYYY 
where YYYY = 2014, 2009, etc 
2) Go to https://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/
search for "NLDAS_FORA0125_H_002" in the GES DISC data collections search area 
Make sure you are looking at hourly data
3) Click on "subset/ Get Data" it is in blue text under "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V002 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H.002)"
4) Change the Download Method to "Get File Subsets using the GES DISC Subsetter." Choose the dates, area, and variables you want. The area JAS used for NYC was: -74.268,40.470,-73.694,40.928
It is helpful to choose just 2 days at first, to make sure everything is running smoothly.
5) Choose the grib data format 
6) Now click "Download Links List" 
This will download a plain text file. This plain text file is just a series of urls. 
Each url is an automatic download; if pasted into a browser, the url would download the grib file for one hour. 
7) Now put that text file into the nldas_YYYY folder and rename the text file following the same convention as the folder (e.g., nldas_YYYY.txt). 
8) Open the terminal 
9) First, change your directory to the nldas_YYYY folder. 
use the command cd, as in cd [directory]    e.g., cd ~/Desktop/nldas_2014 
Note: The format of the cd call may be slightly different on Windows operating systems
10) Now we download each of the urls, using the wget command. wget is a program that automates downloads. Google "download wget" if it is not currently in your computer. 
use this line in the terminal 
wget --input-file=nldas_2014.txt  --content-disposition --user=EarthDataUserName --password=EarthDataPassword -nv &>download.log
Note: The exact syntax may be different for Windows operating systems
11) Data processing for three years of data takes approximately 15 hours. May need to 
use a command first (e.g., caffeinate) to ensure your computer does not go to sleep while processing
