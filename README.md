This repository contains code for recreating all analyses included in the above-titled manuscript. All data is publicly available and can be obtained following directions and / or code included in this repository (but copies of datasets are not included due to their large size). 

Analytic Objectives: Assess (1) the overall impact of NY on PAUSE on TRAP concentrations in NYC, (2) weekday/weekend variation in concentration changes, (3) differences by roadside versus non-roadside monitors, (4) geographic variation in concentration changes, and (5) diurnal variation in concentration changes. 

The repository is organized as follows: 
(1) Obtaining and curating data. This includes files 1_01, 1_02, 1_03, and 1_04
(2) Modeling and results included in the manuscript and supplement. This includes files 2_02, 2_03, and 2_04
(3) Sensitivity analyses. This includes file 3_01
